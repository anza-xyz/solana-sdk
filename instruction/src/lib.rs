//! Types for directing the execution of Solana programs.
//!
//! Every invocation of a Solana program executes a single instruction, as
//! defined by the [`Instruction`] type. An instruction is primarily a vector of
//! bytes, the contents of which are program-specific, and not interpreted by
//! the Solana runtime. This allows flexibility in how programs behave, how they
//! are controlled by client software, and what data encodings they use.
//!
//! Besides the instruction data, every account a program may read or write
//! while executing a given instruction is also included in `Instruction`, as
//! [`AccountMeta`] values. The runtime uses this information to efficiently
//! schedule execution of transactions.
